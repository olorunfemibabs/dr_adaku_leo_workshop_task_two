### The Second Task From The Workshop

Leo is a functional, statically typed programming language built for writing private applications. Leo is a high-level programming language that compiles down to low-level Aleo Instructions.

I changed the transfer function input in the `token.in` file.

I added this:

```
[transfer_private]
sender: token = token {
  owner: aleo19pu64fuk0pgmkxzl2s8mwz9dcex6g4tdh4pmehd9fh9wdz9xdcgshprdr4,
  amount: 10u64,
  _nonce: 710947497959521588541978475371274797290179560223644761302029085270296751312group
};

receiver: address = aleo14f6r8ee728arw8u2mgqfv37xk7lputxk5yman56krp2gn84a8urqfwnkkf;
amount: u64 = 3u64;
```

Used the command:

```
leo run transfer_private
```

I changed the private key in the env file.

I also added a transition `trasnfer_all` in the `main` file

Here is the function below;

```
   //This function `transfer_all` sends the total amount of the token to the receiver from the specified token record.
   transition transfer_all(sender: token, receiver: address) -> (token, token) {
       // Produce a token record with the change amount for the sender.
       let owned: token = token {
           owner: sender.owner,
           amount: 0u64,
       };

       // Produce a token record for the specified receiver.
       let transferred: token = token {
           owner: receiver,
           amount: sender.amount,
       };

        // Output the sender's change record and the receiver's record.
       return (owned, transferred);
   }
```

Lastly, I added the input in the `token.in` file

```
[transfer_all]
sender: token = token {
 owner: aleo19pu64fuk0pgmkxzl2s8mwz9dcex6g4tdh4pmehd9fh9wdz9xdcgshprdr4,
 amount: 7u64,
 _nonce: 710947497959521588541978475371274797290179560223644761302029085270296751312group
};

receiver: address = aleo14f6r8ee728arw8u2mgqfv37xk7lputxk5yman56krp2gn84a8urqfwnkkf;
```

Then run;

```
leo run transfer_all
```
